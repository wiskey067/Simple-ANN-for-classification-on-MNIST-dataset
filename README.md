# Simple ANN for MNIST Classification

This project implements a Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset**. It demonstrates the full workflow of a neural network: data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

---

## Features

- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
- Define a simple fully connected neural network (ANN)
- Train the model using cross-entropy loss and an optimiser
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics
- Plot training loss and visualise sample predictions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
